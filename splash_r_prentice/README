Contents
========

const.R
    This script contains the global constants defined in SPLASH.

data.R
    This script contains functions to handle the file IO for reading and writing data, i.e.:
    - read_csv(character fname, double y=-1)
    - read_txt(list my_data, character fname, character var, double y=-1)

evap.R
    This script contains functions to calculate daily condensation, and evapotranspiration.

main.R
    This script runs the SPLASH model for one year.

solar.R
    This script contains functions to calculate daily radiation fluxes.

splash.R
    This script contains functions for running SPLASH for point-based data, i.e.:
    - spin_up(list mdat, list dtot)
    - quick_run(double lat, double elv, double n, double y, double wn, double sf, double tc, double pn)
    - run_one_day(double lat, double elv, double n, double y, double wn, double sf, double tc, double pn)
